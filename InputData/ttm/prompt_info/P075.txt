This is an Indian pop music piece. The female vocalist is singing in a heart-touching manner. The electric guitar is playing a gentle melody. The bass guitar is the melodic background. The electronic drums and the electronic percussion provide a mid tempo rhythmic background. The overall atmosphere of the piece is sentimental. It could be used in the soundtrack of a Bollywood drama.
