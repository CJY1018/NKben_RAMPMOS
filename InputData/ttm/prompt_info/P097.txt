This is a pop music piece performed acoustically. The male and female vocals take turns singing melodically as a duet. The melody is being played by a ukulele. The aura of the song is very calm and easygoing. It could be used in the soundtrack of a teenage drama. The music could be playing in the background at a coffee house.
